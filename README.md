**_Abstract_**

Georesourcescapes are systems where social practices, carrying elements of both material and immaterial culture, are intertwined with the environment to appropriate a georesource. Natural deposits transform into georesources through the associated sociocultural conditions which cannot be detached from a specific context. However, given the occurrence of a georesource, can we identify and formalise mechanisms explaining the subsequent formation of our georesourcescape?

We address this generic question through the development of middle-range theory on a well-studied case, the trajectory of Iron Age rock salt mining at Dürrnberg, Austria (6th-1st century BC). In contrast with Hallstatt, the earlier salt mining site in its proximity with a mining tradition already proceeding to the Late Bronze Age, Dürrnberg’s evidence shows what was a planned endeavour, where salt played an overarching role in most, if not all, spheres of social and economic interactions. There, salt extraction seems to have fuelled unprecedent intensification, particularly by means of the multiplication of activities and specialisation, making the settlement a regional hub for exchange and crafts.

The perception of mining in general and also the hierarchically organisation of central locations during the Iron Age in archaeology are characterised by recurring narratives. We aim to formalise the current understanding of the Dürrnberg case into an agent-based simulation model. The abstract view on the single agents, like environment and people, social differentiation and hierarchy, may allow to evaluate an evolving set of hypotheses and scenarios illustrating mechanisms forming the underlying sociocultural concept. If so, what factors – possibly not taken into account of the archaeological research yet – should be involved at the micro-level? In this paper, we present the results of the initial modelling phase, a schema representing salt mining as it is entangled with other activities and to aspects in transversal domains, such as demography, food economy and social structure.
